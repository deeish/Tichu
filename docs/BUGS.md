--Players are still being skipped, specifically player 4 for some reason but also other players.
--Some players getting double turns for some reason(probably a bug when other players are already finished with their hand)
--Player played a bomb, and the turn went to the player after for some reason even though they didnt win.
-- Bug: If the player did not start the round they are allowed to pass(as long as they didnt get dogged or have the mah jong wish) 
-- Players cannot call tichu and grand tichu(its one or the other)
--a bug with gameplay, a player got "dogged" by his teammate, they played a pair(which is legal) then the other player tried to play a higher pair but the game registered the play as a single for some reason.
-- the bomb isnt working on a "dog round" the rule is that you cannot bomb when a dog is played, but after the "teammate" plays his card or cards after being dogged they are allowed to be bombed.
