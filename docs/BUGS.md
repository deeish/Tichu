✅ FIXED - when a card is played if the other 3 players pass (meaning no one beat your current hand) you claim the cards and it is your turn again

⚠️ INVESTIGATING - Current calculations are off (not adding score correctly)

—hide score until the end of the round(add later)

⚠️ FIXED - mah Jong rules need to be fixed, very buggy currently (wish logic corrected)

*********
Bug Status:
✅ = Fixed and verified
⚠️ = Fixed but needs testing/verification
*** = Not yet fixed

Rotation of play:
- ✅ FIXED - when player 1 plays a card if player 2 and 3 pass it doesnt give player 4 a chance to play

Dog:
- ✅ FIXED - When played priority goes to my teammate, if they finished their hand already priority goes to the next player(even if they are not a teammate)
- ✅ FIXED - If a player gets priority by Dog, they are allowed to play any hand not just singles
- ⚠️ FIXED - Dog priority bug fixed (can now play any combination without beating Dog)
- View dog as you're passing a "winning hand" to a person, so they cannot pass and can play any combonation of cards

✅ FIXED - When a player 1 finished their hand and no one beats it, the priority should go to player 2 not player 4

✅ FIXED - when a player gets priority they are never allowed to pass, they have to play a card

✅ FIXED - Bug somewhere, if a player wins their hand make sure they get priority

Phoenix
- ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING - Check all logic with this, i tried to play it as Phoenix, Q, J, J (which is a sequential) check to make sure this is valid (logic appears correct but needs real-world testing)
