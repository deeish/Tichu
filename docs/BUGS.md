—when a card is played if the other 3 players pass (meaning no one beat your current hand) you claim the cards and it is your turn again (currently you get to play 1 more hand)

—Current calculations are off (not adding score correctly)

—hide score until the end of the round(add later)

— mah Jong rules need to be fixed, very buggy currently

*********
Make sure these got fixed
*** (means they didnt get fixed)

Rotation of play:
- ***when player 1 plays a card if player 2 and 3 pass it doesnt give player 4 a chance to 
play(doesnt always happen, find where the bug could lie)

Dog:
-When played priority goes to my teammate, if they finished their hand already priority goes to the next player(even if they are not a teammate)
- If a player gets priority by Dog, they are allowed to play any hand not just singles
-****Still not working, dog is not giving priority to a teammate even if they have hards.
-View dog as you're passing a "winning hand" to a person, so they cannot pass and can play any combonation of cards

***
When a player 1 finished their hand and no one beats it, the priority should go to player 2 not player 4

***
when a player gets priority they are never allowed to pass, they have to play a card

***
Bug somewhere, if a player wins their hand make sure they get priority

Pheonix
-Check all logic with this, i tried to play it as Pheonix, Q, J, J (which is a sequential) check to make sure this is valid
